# My Learning Behavior and How I'm Planning to Improve It

I'm a non-native English speaker, so I sometimes have difficulty reading in English.  
Ever since I started learning programming (at least over 5 years ago), English words have confused me. What's even worse is that I read about technology, making it even more difficult to understand what I was reading.

I had to learn both English and tech at the same time. Since I didn't fully understand what I was reading, it seemed like I was prioritizing quantity over quality—and I really was. It felt like I somewhat understood what I had just read, but only certain parts of it.

Deep down, I knew this was not good at all. My mind kept saying:
> "I do programming, and even worse, I do full-stack. I have so many things to learn. I can't just spend time reading this over and over until I fully understand it. I have other things to learn."

For example, when I tried to learn JavaScript thoroughly, I read almost all the pages of [_javascript.info_](https://javascript.info/), but my mind was also occupied with other things, such as TypeScript:
> "After this, I have to learn TypeScript. I know nothing about TypeScript. And after that, I have to read about some framework, etc."

The funny thing was that I read almost all the pages of [_javascript.info_](https://javascript.info/), and I somewhat remembered terms and concepts such as `'use strict'`, modules, Promises, and vaguely about JavaScript numbers and their quirks.

But if you asked me to explain JavaScript modules, I wouldn't be able to. I would just say:
> "Well, we have `export` and `import`. You export variables and functions from one file and import them into another if you want to use them."

Beyond this answer, I would have nothing more to say. Cases like this frustrate me because I remember:
> "Oh, I read the whole page about JavaScript modules, but when the time comes, I don't remember even half of it."

So, what's the point of reading and learning this article? I'll probably forget it too. And just like that, the cycle continues.

I want to end this. Something is wrong with my learning style. I researched this issue and found some solutions. Below are some of them:

- **Active Recall** (thinking about what I just learned without looking at it) - *my current chosen method*
- **Spaced Repetition** (reviewing it again after some time) - *boring, I can't just keep reading the same thing. I have other things to do!*
- **Teach Someone Else** - *ain't no way, I'm an introvert*
- **Apply It Practically** - *a lot of things can't be done practically*
- **Reading Out Loud** - *I ain't a fool!*
- **Mind Mapping or Note Taking** - *I already tried; it didn’t help*

So from this list, I chose to do **active recall**. I will write relevant articles about what I just learned.  
While writing, I will think deeply about the topic and try to explain it in a simpler way.

Starting today, I will try to write about what I learn on this blog, and hopefully, it will work out for me.

Thanks for reading this, and I hope you liked it.
