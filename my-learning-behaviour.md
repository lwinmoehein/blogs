# My Learning Behaviour and How I'm Planning to Improve It

I'm a non-English native speaker, so I sometimes have difficulty while reading something in English.  
Ever since I started learning programming (at least over 5 years ago), the English words confused me. And what's even worse is that I read about technology, making it even more difficult to understand what I was reading.

I had to learn both English and tech at the same time. Since I didn't fully understand what I was reading, it seemed like I was prioritizing quantity over quality. And I really was. It was like I somewhat understood what I just read, but only some parts of it.

Deep down, I knew it was not good at all. My mind was like:
> "I do this programming, and even worse, I do full-stack. I have so many things to learn. I cannot just spend time reading this thing over and over until I fully understand it. I have another thing to learn."

For example, when I tried to learn JavaScript fully, like reading almost all pages of [_javascript.info_](https://javascript.info/), my mind was also on something else such as TypeScript:
> "After this, I have to learn TypeScript. I know nothing about TypeScript, etc. And after that, I have to read about some framework, etc."

The funny thing was, I read almost all pages of [_javascript.info_](https://javascript.info/), and I somewhat remembered terms and concepts such as `'use strict'`, modules, Promises, and vaguely about JavaScript numbers and their strangeness.

But if you asked me to explain JavaScript modules, I wouldn't be able to. I would just say:
> "Well, we have `export` and `import`. You export the variables and functions from one file and import them into another if you want to use them."

Apart from this answer, I would have nothing more to say. Cases like this disturb me when I read something because I remember,
> "Oh, I read the whole page about JavaScript modules, but when the time comes, I don't remember even half of it."

So, what's the point of even reading and learning about this current article? I will also forget this. And like this, the cycle continues.

I want to end this. Something is wrong with my style of learning things. I researched this and found some solutions. Below are some of them:

- **Active Recall** (thinking about what I just learned without looking at it) - *my current chosen method*
- **Spaced Repetition** (read it again after some time) - *boring, I can't just keep reading this. I have other things too!*
- **Teach Someone Else** - *ain't no way, I'm an introvert*
- **Apply It Practically** - *a lot of things can't be done practically*
- **Reading Out Loud** - *I ain't a fool!*
- **Mind Mapping or Note Taking** - *I already tried, it didn't help*

So from this list, I chose to do **active recall**. I will write relevant articles about what I just learned.  
And while writing, I will think about it deeply and try to explain it simpler.

Starting from today, I will try to write what I learned on this blog, and hopefully, it will work out for me.

Thanks for reading this, and I hope you liked it.
